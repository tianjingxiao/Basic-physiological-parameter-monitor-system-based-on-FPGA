# Basic physiological parameter monitor system based on FPGA

This is my personal project

Aug 2021 - Nov 2021

● Design the board-level peripheral circuits of Xilinx Basys FPGA, including power supply, communication interface, and display 8-bit parallel data through the digital tube.

● Develop the state machine to control timing, and the DS18B20 temperature sensor and Pulse Sensor are controlled by reading and writing data many times through the I/O bus to realize temperature conversion and output clear waveforms.
